# NavigationGraph3
The third xamarin.android NavigationComponent project. Each of the projects contains a Word doc file describing all three projects  

NavigationGraph1 – shows the basics of building a Xamarin.Android using Android’s Navigation Component.

NavigationGraph2 – introduces an alternate method of adding animations from one fragment to another.

NavigationGraph3 - this project is quite a departure from the preceding ones. It introduces several new features that could be incorporated into Xamarin.Android project.
